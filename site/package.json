I built this website with flexibility in mind - that is, I wanted to have full control over customizing the content on my website, rather than having to re-upload HTML files each time I wanted to make a minor change. Using Javascript and Firebase, I was able to set up a framework for me to easily make new additions to my website just by manipulating information in the database.",
