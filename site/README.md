# This is my personal website. 

Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Google Firebase, this website does more than just display my progress. I built this website with flexibility in mind - that is, I wanted to have full control over customizing the content on my website, rather than having to re-upload HTML files each time I wanted to make a minor change. Using Javascript and Firebase, I was able to set up a framework for me to easily make new additions to my website just by manipulating information in the database. 


Whats Next?

Currently, I am developing a Website Companion Application using Android Studio that will allow me to manipulate my website directly from my phone. This will give me incredible flexibility over my personal website, as I will be able to immediately make additions to my website just by pushing images and/or text straight from my phone. Code from this project will be uploaded as well.
